## How to contribute and basic rules  
  
- Always, ALWAYS create a new branch for a specific feature you're implementing at the moment.  
- For a branch to be approved for merge, it has to pass every test there is.  
- For every test you create, just let me know and we'll go through it together to check for possible bugs  


I reserve the right to change the contributing rules without prior notice.
